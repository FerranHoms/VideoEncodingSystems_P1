This is a branch made from the state of seminar 2, where the code for Practice 2 (Transcoding) is added.

To run it, docker must be installed in the computer. Then, run "docker-compose up --build".

Now we have a GUI. Once the containers are running, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080 to use the simple website I made to test the monster API. You can still go to http://localhost:8000/docs to see the automatic API documentaion generated by FastAPI if you prefer.

IMPORTANT: For the conversion endpoint (exercise 1), the conversions take A LOT of time. I tried them all (vp8, h265 and av1) and they work, so maybe its better if you trust me rather than waiting hehe.

For the last step regarding AI, I used Gemini 3, which is one of the best models out there. It helped me refactoring and optimizing the code and also gave the UI a much better look. The git diff command output can be looked at the "git_diff_output.png" image.
