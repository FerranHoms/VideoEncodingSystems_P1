This is a branch made from the delivered state of practice 1, where the code for seminar 2 will be added.

To run it, docker must be installed in the computer. Then, run "docker-compose up --build" and once is done, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs to see the automatic API documentaion generated by FastAPI, **where the endpoints can be tested**.

In order for the endpoints of this seminar to work, it is first needed to make a petition to the /download-bbb endpoint, which will download the video that the rest of the endpoints need.
