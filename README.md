**THIS "main" BRANCH HAS THE CODE FOR PRACTICE 2**
**THE CODE FOR SEMINAR 2 IS IN BRANCH "seminar2** 

I used the AI refactored code from seminar1 (made in 8, as explained in seminar 1 README.md) as the logic behind the API for more robustness, since I understand this practice is about making the API and encapsulating the service inside a docker container, not about what the logic behind the API actually does.

To run it, docker must be installed in the computer. Then, run "docker-compose up --build" and once is done, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs to see the automatic API documentaion generated by FastAPI, where each endpoints can also be tested.
